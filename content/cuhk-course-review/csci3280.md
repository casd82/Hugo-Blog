# Review
Usually, this course contains a group project where students work on a P2P music streaming desktop application. However, this year, since it was online teaching, we only needed to turn in 4 programming assignments. They weren't difficult concept-wise, but just really tricky to implement correctly since they involved some amount of 3D math.

<br />

Though the professor had good delivering skills, he talked mostly about general non-technical topics during the lectures. As I was expecting to learn some interesting multimedia algorithms, I didn't really enjoy most of the lectures.

<br />

Probably the course would be more interesting if it were taught face-to-face. But for online teaching, I wouldn't recommend taking this course.
