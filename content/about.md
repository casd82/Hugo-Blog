I'm Yu Chao (趙佑). I kill time by [reading novels](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18427549.Yu_Chao) and listening to music (mostly Brit rock). I murder time by [drawing](https://www.instagram.com/yuchao.jpg/), writing, and creating [random stuff](/projects).

# Experience
* The first couple decades of being alive.
* [Also these](https://yuchao.page/).

# TL;DR
I am a good person. Kind of.
