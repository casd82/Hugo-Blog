I'm Yu Chao. I got my BSc. Computer Science degree at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and I'm currently a software engineer located at Taipei.

<br />

I usually dump technical articles in this blog, but you might see some non-technical ones occasionally as well.

<br />

This blog was named "Shine Right Studio" 5 years ago because when directly translating "Shine" and "Right" into Mandarin, they were homophones of my name. Now I think it is pretty dumb and cringy, but I am too lazy to make a change.

# TL;DR
I am a good person.
